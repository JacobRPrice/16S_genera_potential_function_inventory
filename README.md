 for post high-throughput sequencing analysis
 intially created for QIIME1, QIIME2, mothur pipeline

For each genus identified by post-sequencing processing (using Greengenes_13_8 via mothur or QIIME, or SILVA_132_99 via QIIME2), a potential function was identified through a literature review. When formally describing a new genus, a battery of physiological tests are conducted on the cultured type species. These studies provided the potential function of each genus. Some notable exceptions are when a genus or type species could not be cultured in isolation and were cultured in consortia or observed in its natural habitat. 

“Potential function (initial)” describes how each genus was described in the initial paper; “potential function” denotes the broad functional group used for downstream analyses.
